# Actual-Final-Project

The goal of this program is to emulate tetris with 5 block tiles. This is achieved through a few goals:

DONE-  Making a functioning block generator from a list of 7 blocks, and draw it on the screen using PyGame

1/2 DONE, other blocks have not been implimented - Making a functioning collision system for those blocks, both for the screen and with other blocks

NOT DONE - Clearing lines after they have been filled horizontally

NOT DONE - Ending the program after the user has reached the top

All of the functionallity hasn't been added as of submitting this
