# Actual-Final-Project

The goal of this program is to emulate tetris with 5 block tiles. This is achieved through a few goals:

Making a functioning block generator from a list of 7 blocks, and draw it on the screen using PyGame

Making a functioning collision system for those blocks, both for the screen and with other blocks

Clearing lines after they have been filled horizontally

Ending the program after the user has reached the top
